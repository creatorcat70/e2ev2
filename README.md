# e2ev2
An end to end encryption tool in a single html file.

# How to use
Exchange your public key with whoever you are chatting with. After that type your message and press encrypt to encrypt and decrypt to... decrypt.

Optionally visit the URL below instead of downloading the html:
https://cuhassle.github.io/e2ev2/e2ev2.html

# Note
This has NO backend whatsoever so you will have to use an already existing backend like google chat. This project was originally intended to be used to securely send messages on google chat.

# PS
This is NOT completely safe. One problem with the web is that any browser extension can spy on you.

# How it Works
(For the 1 person who actually cares) This uses the ellipcical curve diffie hellman algorithm to exchange a key which is then used for AES symmetric encryption.
